Project Structure:
- **Back_End**: Contains server-side scripts and SQL files for database management.
- **Front_End**: Includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP files for user interface and functionality.
  
Usage Notes:
- Make sure to configure your SQL environment to support MySQL syntax.
- Permissions are required for database creation and table modification before executing scripts.
- Be cautious with the command `DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS AutoTuneDB;` as it will delete the database if it exists.
