## Project Structure

- **Back_End**: Server-side scripts, database models, controllers, routes, and SQL files for managing database operations.
- **Front_End**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP files, and assets for the user interface and client-side functionality.
- **Database**: Configuration files, migrations, and seed data for database setup.
- **Documentation**: Contains this README, API documentation, troubleshooting information, and contributing guidelines.
- **Tests**: Test cases for both front-end and back-end features.
- **Logs**: Access and error logs for debugging purposes.
- **Config**: Environment configuration files for database and application settings.

## Installation and Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the project files:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Database Setup**: Import the `AutoTuneDB_Schema.sql` file into your MySQL server to establish the database schema.

3. **Configure Database Connection**: Update `/Front_End/db_autotune.php` with your MySQL database credentials.

4. **Run the Application**: Open the project in a web server environment that supports PHP and MySQL (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP).

5. **Testing**: Test functionality by navigating to the login and registration pages, creating an account, and entering vehicle data to ensure smooth data entry and retrieval.

## Usage

- **User Login**: Log in with your credentials.
- **Add Vehicle Information**: Use the vehicle entry form to add vehicle details.
- **View Service History**: Check the service logs for maintenance records.
- **Manage Profile**: Update your profile details in the account settings.

## Usage Notes

- Configure your SQL environment to support MySQL syntax.
- Ensure you have permissions for database creation and modification before running any scripts.
- Be cautious with the command `DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS AutoTuneDB;` as it will delete the database if it already exists.
